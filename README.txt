1. How many packets are there in this set?

	There are 861 packets in this set	


2. What protocol was used to transfer files from the PC to the server?

	FTP-DATA, which is FTP or File Transfer Protocol into the
	specific port specified for data (20 I believe)


3. Briefly describe why the protocol to transfer the files is insecure.

	FTP transfers in plaintext, meaning I can pull the data
	transferred and it becomes a functional file of whatever
	type it was.


4. What is the secure alternative to the protocol used to transfer files?

	SFTP


5. What is the IP Address of the server?

	192.168.1.8	


6. What was the username and password used to access the server?

	username = 'defcon'
	password = 'm1ngisablowhard'	


7. How many files were transferred to PC from server?

10. How many packets are there in this set?


11. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set?
    Please count any anonymous or generic accounts.


12. Briefly descripbe how you found the username-password pairs.


13. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify
    the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name
    (e.g. google.com), and port number


14. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how
    many of them are legitimate? That is, the username-password was valid,
    access successfully granted?

15. How many plaintext username-password pairs are there in this packet set?
    Please count any anonymous or generic accounts.


16. For each of the plaintext username-password pair that you found, identify
    the protocol used, server IP, the corresponding domain name
    (e.g. google.com), and port number


17. Of all the plaintext username-password pairs that you found, how
    many of them are legitimate? That is, the username-password was valid,
    access successfully granted?


18. Provide a listing of all IP addresses with corresponding hosts
    (hostname + domain name) that are in this PCAP set. Describe
    your methodology.


~~ General Questions ~~
19. How did you verify the successful username-password pairs?


20. What advice would you give to the owners of the username-password
    pairs that you found so their account information would not be revealed
    "in-the-clear" in the future?
