Matt Long's Final Paper and Deliverable.



The deliverable I chose to make was an interactive, hand-holding command line
tool for Shodan. It took me a while to familiarize myself with the website
interface, and even now there are parts I'm not entirely sure what's going on.

Using the Shodan Python library, I (started to) put together a command-line
tool that walks you through the library's functionality. Right now, only the
'info' part is working due to time constraints.

Also, there's no requirements.txt, so the user has to 'easy_install shodan' 
to make the program work.

Welcome to the dev branch - here's what I want to add to the tool:
    * search functionality (because that's what the tool's all about)
    * actionable things to do when results are returned
    * export to file functionality (does this break API rules?)
    * anything else I have labeled as TODO in the comments
