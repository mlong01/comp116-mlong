Matt Long's Final Paper and Deliverable.



The deliverable I chose to make was an interactive, hand-holding command line
tool for Shodan. It took me a while to familiarize myself with the website
interface, and even now there are parts I'm not entirely sure what's going on.

Using the Shodan Python library, I (started to) put together a command-line
tool that walks you through the library's functionality. Right now, only the
'info' part is working due to time constraints.

Also, there's no requirements.txt, so the user has to 'easy_install shodan' 
to make the program work.

As it is now 6:00, I am submitting all that I have completed right now. I want
to work more on the interactive Shodan tool, but I'll do that on a different
branch. What you see in master is what I have finished at 6:00
